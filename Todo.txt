Battles:
    On Create Game, add battles at certain turn numbers (slight randomness)
    In the turn manager, if battles.includes(turn) game.battling = true
        Divide the players into pairs. for each pair, create a battle Object and attach it to the game (game.battles)
        Battle Object:
            players : { player: id,name , cards }
            graveyard : card[]
            ended: false
            turnOrder : string[]
            turn : 1
    
    In the game page, if game.battling return <Battle /> (no gamehud, just battlehud)
