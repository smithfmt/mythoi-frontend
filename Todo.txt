Add Bots to the lobby

Battles:
    In the turn manager, if battles.includes(turn) game.battling = true
        Divide the players into pairs. for each pair, create a battle Object and attach it to the game (game.battles)

    Add a Condition so that when there is an unfinished battle, other api requests (end turn etc.) don't work

    In the game page, if game.battling return <Battle /> (no gamehud, just battlehud)

    
In the Battle, on a user's turn, they want to be able to click on one of their cards then:
    A UI for that card shows up with some toggleable buttons (attack, ability and their name and values);
    
    by default the attacking button is toggled and the user's mouse turns into a target - an event listener is added to the enemy cards, with onhover: setHoveredCard(card)
    another event listener is set on the window: onClick: if(hoveredCard) try to attack / cast on that card.

    using the hoveredCard state, we can realtime show the effected hp values on the user's card and the hoveredCard (and display when someone will be killed - greyed out, or damaged - hp goes red)

-- Long Term Refactoring --
Move anything currently stored as Json to have its own db tables (battle player.gameData etc.) - use relationals to link them

-- Minor bugs --
Shop should cycle on its own (not only when people buy)
Horseman should not be bolt
When battle starts, the view doesn't change without refresh
