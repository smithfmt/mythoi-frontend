Todo:

- End a battle when a player runs out of cards not in graveyard

- Keep track of who wins the battles (give them a point)

- End game when total number of battles have been completed


- Add a cast action when casting is toggled on, and implement system where each card can have a certain ability

- Implement a stage for passive abilities to be active


Image flickering on Firefox and/or chrome. dragging too fast on chrome

for some reason god cost array was only 4

Add Bots to the lobby

Shop cards not updating when a card is bought

Gods costing 4 (Hermes)

Battles:
    In the turn manager, if battles.includes(turn) game.battling = true
        Divide the players into pairs. for each pair, create a battle Object and attach it to the game (game.battles)

    Add a Condition so that when there is an unfinished battle, other api requests (end turn etc.) don't work

In the Battle, on a user's turn, they want to be able to click on one of their cards then:
    A UI for that card shows up with some toggleable buttons (attack, ability and their name and values);
    
    by default the attacking button is toggled and the user's mouse turns into a target - an event listener is added to the enemy cards, with onhover: setHoveredCard(card)
    another event listener is set on the window: onClick: if(hoveredCard) try to attack / cast on that card.

-- Long Term Refactoring --

add zod to validate types
move to zustand for global state (gameData / lobbyData etc.)

-- Minor bugs --
Shop should cycle on its own (not only when people buy)

When Fetching Data - change everything to use Promise.all();
